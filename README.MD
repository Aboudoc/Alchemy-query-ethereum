getBlockNumber
eth_getBlockByNumber.

Try running it (remember to save the file!) by running node index - you should see the contents of mainnet block #46147 printed out on your console.

2. Run the Axios Request With Another Method!
   Now that we have a file setup and it is successfully querying the Ethereum blockchain via JSON-RPC, pick a different method from the Ethereum JSON-RPC API and plug it into your script!
   Remember, you'll need to re-structure the script to account for the new method. Particularly, the params will most likely be different per method call.

Change the method value to the method you want to use
Change the params value to what that method calls for parameters in the specs
Practice as many READ queries as you can. You are making read queries to the Ethereum computer like a champ... how cool is that?
